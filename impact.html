            <h1>Every student’s ADHD presents itself in unique ways. <small> There's still an impact on learning.</small></h1>
            <h2>Usually the problem lies in their executive function. <small>That is, their working memory, cognitive flexibility (flexible thinking), and inhibitory control (including self-control).</small></h2>
            <h3>This can present challenges for students with ADHD with learning in academic environments and may negatively affect their school performance.</h3>
            <h3>We have highlighted different areas where students with ADHD may experience difficulty.</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Reading</h4>
                <h5>Trouble with the executive function of working memory may make it difficult for younger students to remember the rules of reading.
                    Trouble with self-control and focus can also impact how well they understand what they’ve read.
                    Students with ADHD may demonstrate difficulty recalling what they read earlier in the text and connecting it to what they’re reading now.
                    It is not uncommon that a student with ADHD will read a text and have difficulty remembering what the text said if asked questions about it.
                    Some students may also rush to get done faster and miss key details or forget to take the time to think about what they’ve read.
                    It is common for students with ADHD to struggle with fully completing reading assignments as they often have difficulty focusing and completing tasks once they have lost interest.
                </h5>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Writing</h4>
                <h5>Since students with ADHD may experience difficulty with planning, organization and self-monitoring they are likely to experience challenges developing strong writing skills.
                    Distractibility can make writing very time consuming and often can lead to skipping ideas or incompletion of writing assignments.
                    A tendency to make impulsive decisions can result in poor spelling, weak vocabulary choices, and reliance on simple sentence structure.
                    For students who experience trouble with planning and organization, it can create jumbled sequencing of ideas.
                    Trouble getting started or picking a topic are also characteristics you may notice of a student with ADHD.
                </h5>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Spelling</h4>
                <h5>Students who experience difficulty with writing often aren’t focused and rush through what they are writing, which can easily lead to spelling mistakes.
                    Learning with ADHD can make it harder to commit words and spelling rules to memory.
                    Attention issues can also make it harder for the brain to organize information and retrieve it when needed.
                    Students with ADHD may substitute, leave out or switch the order of letters in words.
                </h5>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Math</h4>
                <h5>Trouble paying attention can lead some students to make math mistakes as well.
                    Students with ADHD may find difficulty recalling or using math rules and formulas.
                    They may experience trouble following the series of steps needed to solve math problems with several steps.
                    Students might not complete math problems if they can’t remember all the steps or may give up before reaching the final step of a problem.
                    Another tendency is to impulsively rush through math problems without checking for accuracy.
                </h5>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Mental Math</h4>
                <h5>Trouble focusing and staying on task may make it difficult for students with ADHD to connect what they’ve learned to old and new experiences. I
                    t also makes it hard to commit information to long-term memory and may lead to gaps in basic skills.
                    It can be hard to recall facts or follow the procedures of mental calculations.
                    Trouble with working memory can also create difficulty with the memorization of math facts.
                    They may also struggle with organizing the steps they use to solve a problem or rush through a problem and miss important details.
                </h5>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Classroom Management</h4>
                <h5>Students with ADHD may also have difficulties with maintaining attention, executive function and working memory.
                    Executive function is the brain’s ability to prioritize and manage thoughts and actions.
                    This ability permits individuals to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and guide their behavior across time more effectively.
                    Individuals who have issues with executive functioning may have difficulties completing tasks, may forget important things or instructions.
                    They may blurt out answers or create disruptions in class that may appear as poor behavior or lack of self-control.
                </h5>
